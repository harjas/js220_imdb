# IMDb Top 250 Angular App
Starting this week, we will begin working on a larger application. Over next three weeks we'll be building an application that we can interact with to get info on IMDb's Top 250 movies. 

## Getting Started
1. Fork (not clone) this repository to your Github account
2. Clone the repository from your account
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Assignment
For this assigment, we'll be setting up the routing for our application. We looked at ng-route in class today (the code can be found inside js220_todoApp repo under my account). The application will have three pages - list view (where we can search for movies), gallery view (where all the titles can be seen in one place) and detail view (details of a selected movie). 

Your job is to add routing inside `app.js` for list, gallery and detail views. There are comments inside to help you too. I have created three template files (list.html, gallery.thml and detail.html) inside the templates folder. Use those inside your router. 

## Submission
Once you're done coding, commit all your code to your github account and create a pull request. The pull request will be for my repo which will allow me to look at all the changes/updates you made to the project. I can leave comments on your code too. Hopefully this submission process works. If it's too cumbersome and/or things don't work out, we can look into something else. 

Good luck!
